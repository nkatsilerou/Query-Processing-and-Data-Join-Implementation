Developed programs to evaluate complex database queries and operations on two datasets stored in CSV files, using algorithms like merge-sort and merge-join. The project included implementing grouping with aggregation, natural join, and composite queries to calculate results based on multiple criteria. Designed and optimized algorithms to process datasets efficiently without loading entire files into memory. The implementation adhered to SQL-like query requirements, showcasing expertise in algorithm development, data processing, and performance optimization.
